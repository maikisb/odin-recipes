    <p><ul><li>1 pound (450g) flank steak or skirt steak</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>8 small flour or corn tortillas</li>
    <li>Optional toppings: diced onions, chopped cilantro, sliced avocado, lime wedges, salsa, sour cream, shredded cheese</li></ul></p>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p><ol><li>In a bowl, combine the olive oil, minced garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, and black pepper to create a marinade.</li>
        <li>Place the flank steak or skirt steak in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over it. Rub the marinade into the meat, ensuring it is evenly coated. Allow the steak to marinate for at least 30 minutes, or refrigerate for up to 4 hours for more flavor.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill or a skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>If using a grill, cook the steak for about 4-6 minutes per side for medium-rare, or adjust the cooking time according to your desired doneness. If using a skillet, cook the steak for about 3-5 minutes per side. Cooking times may vary depending on the thickness of the steak.</li>
        <li>Once cooked to your liking, remove the steak from the heat and let it rest for a few minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute within the meat.</li>
        <li>Slice the steak thinly against the grain to ensure tender and easy-to-bite pieces.</li>
        <li>Warm the tortillas either on the grill or in a dry skillet over medium heat for a few seconds on each side until they become pliable.</li>
        <li>Assemble the tacos by placing a few slices of steak on each tortilla. Add your desired toppings such as diced onions, chopped cilantro, sliced avocado, lime wedges, salsa, sour cream, or shredded cheese.</li>
        <li>Serve the steak tacos immediately and enjoy!</li></ol></p>
        <p>These steak tacos are bursting with flavor and make for a satisfying meal. Customize them with your favorite toppings and savor the delicious combination of tender steak and vibrant spices.</p>
