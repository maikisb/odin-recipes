    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef or Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 can (14 ounces/400g) crushed tomatoes</li>
<li>1 can (6 ounces/170g) tomato paste</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
<li>2 cups (500g) ricotta cheese</li>
<li>2 cups (200g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>1/2 cup (50g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
<li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><ol><li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
<li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat. Add the diced onion and minced garlic and cook until the onion is translucent and the meat is fully cooked. Drain any excess grease.</li>
<li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
<li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Spread about one-third of the cheese mixture over the noodles. Repeat these layers twice, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
<li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.</li>
<li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired.</li></ol></p>
